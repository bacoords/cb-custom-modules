== Description ==

Crafty Beaver Custom Modules is a free suite of elegant custom modules for for Beaver Builder that highlight photography with smooth animations, interactions, and hover effects. This is an extension of the Beaver Builder page builder plugin.

* Shade - Add sleek hover effects and custom colors to your background images. Overlay them with custom WYSIWYG content and even make them clickable.
* Spotlight - Create your own list of custom links on one side that each replaces the 'spotlight' photo on the other. Customize column sizes and more.
* Broadside - Horizontal slider to showcase design work, posters, photography, and more. Responsive and responds to touch on mobile. Clicking on images opens them in the beautiful default BB lightbox.
* Scout - Sticky navbar that fixes to the top of the screen when it gets there, allowing smooth scrolling to other elements on the page.
* Dust - Utilizing the popular Particles.js library, this module helps you make custom heros with cool interactive, animated backgrounds.
* Slice - Animated photo gallery with stacked, 'sliding cards' effect. Integrates with the default Beaver Builder lightbox.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I install this plugin without Beaver Builder? =

Yes, but it won't do anything. This plugin is an extension to [Beaver Builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/).

= What about browsers? =

CB Custom Modules uses some modern CSS specs like Flexbox and animations. Modules will all work, but with older versions of IE you might see a less-refined version.

= Are these modules responsive? =

Yes. Some modules maintain their same behavior on mobile, but modules that rely on hover effects provide an experience tailored to touch screens.

= Is this plugin open source? =

[Yes](https://github.com/bacoords/cb-custom-modules). Feel free to use and adapt as needed. Or reach out to me with any feature requests.

= For the scout module, how do I make the page scroll to another part of the page? =

1. Find the row or element you want to scroll to, find the Advanced Settings tab, give that element a unique id such as *gallery*.
1. When you add your link to the module, the link field would need to be *#gallery*. The plugins do the rest.

The Beaver Builder team also has a great [breakdown](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/knowledge-base/smooth-scrolling-buttons-icons-and-links/) of this technique with screenshots.

= Can I get a custom module made for me or my client? =

Of course! Visit our [website](https://www.cbcustommodules.com/request-module) to learn more about requesting a custom module.

= Does CB Custom Modules work with Beaver Themer? =

Yes! Most modules have Beaver Field Connections where appropriate.
